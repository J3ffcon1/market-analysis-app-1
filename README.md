*The Market Anaylsis Voting App*

In this class assignment, we were instructed to created a product voting web app that let's potential consumers choose
their favorite product from among 3 product options by clicking on the photo of that product. The results are 
then displayed in a bar chart format if the voter presses the button that appears after 15 votes.
